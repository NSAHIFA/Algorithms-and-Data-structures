## Compiling the project

This section shows how to run a specific class from the project using the JDK

1. Create a classes folder 
```
mkdir classes
```
2. Compile the class 

```
javac -sourcepath src/main/java -d classes <absolute path to the class>
```

3. Run the algorithm

```
java -cp classes <Name of the class>
```
